### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a passioned web developer that cannot stop.
Not much time to open-source stuff but I'm trying to share what I can ðŸ˜‰.
My favorite tech stack:
 - FE: Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Tailwind, Typescript. Those allow to build coolest UIs faster then ever. With the help of Storybook decoupling base building blocks of the UI is a breeze. Also have quite some experince in React and Ember.
 - BE: Scala was the best language I've ever used. Followed by Typescript and Python. PHP is not so exciting anymore.
 - Infra: Ansible, Terraform and k8s changed my world recently. GitOps changed it again.
